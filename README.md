# TuringMachine RS

A Turing Machine Simulation Library written in Rust

## About

This small library allows you to easily model the backend for Turing machines with
Turing tapes. It provides a theoretically infinite `TuringTape` struct and
possibilities for any wanted alphabet.

## Usage

If you want to use TuringMachine RS, you can add the crate to your _Cargo.toml_:

```toml
[dependencies]
turingmachine-rs = "0.1.0"
```

For examples on how to use the crate, I suggest looking at the integration
tests in the `/tests` folder.
